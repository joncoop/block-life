# Block Life

This started off as a very basic clone of one of the training games in [Duck Life 4](http://www.abcya.com/duck_life_4.htm), but I'm not gonna lie. Right now this game is pretty epic.

## Instructions ##

The goal is to last as long as you can by falling through the gaps in the platforms. When the block hit the ceiling, the game is over. Use the arrow keys to move the block from side to side. The block will wrap around to the opposite side of the screen if it goes off the edge. 

## Scoring ##

The score increasses continuously during play so the longer you last, the higher your score. Try to collect as many stars as you can. They are 100 points each.

## Power-ups ##

After 15 stars are gathered, the block gets a speed boost.
